# SoapClient
Example of a Soap Client with Spring Web Services

This is an excellent example of creating a soap client service using the Spring Framework Web Services library.

The sample service address I'm sending the request to is: http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso?wsdl

The concept of SoapGateway and the generalization of calls are demonstrated. As this is an example, of course, you can make generalizations such as url + request method in your own projects.
